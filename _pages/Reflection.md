In the process of putting together this website I learned a lot. One of the things I learned was to appreciate non vascular plants, or at least to appreciate them more. I've always liked moss, but discovering that there were liverworts in my yard, which I had never noticed before, has led to me paying significantly closer attention to the miniature forests of bryophytes and lichens while on hikes and the like.  
Reading through the ID guides also helped to refine my understanding of the traits of the plants I focused on. I could already identify all of the vascular plants I wrote about when on a walk in the local area, but Iâ€™m not sure I would have been able to differentiate red and yellow cedar for instance, or describe which features I was using to identify the plants if asked. Now, I believe I would be able to better identify the plants even when in a different context.
