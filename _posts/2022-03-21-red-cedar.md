## Identification
Western Red Cedar is a coniferous tree that can grow up to 60m tall and 8m in diameter (Western Red Cedar, 2016; Western Red Cedar: Detailed, n.d.). The bark is fibrous, with a grey appearance when weathered, but a reddish brown when unweathered or freshly exposed (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). The branches are drooping, with flattened fans of foliage (Western Red Cedar: Detailed, n.d.; Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). The leaves themselves are evergreen and scale-like, with overlapping scales (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). These scale-like leaves are only slightly prickly with blunted points, and are arranged on a flat plane (Douglas et al., 1998). If the tree has cones, they will be small, roughly 1 cm, and longer than they are wide (Douglas et al., 1998; Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.).

## Ecology
Western Red Cedar is a coastal tree, and is most often found growing in shaded regions with moist soil (Western Red Cedar: Detailed, n.d.). However, it is also found in drier regions and bogs, albeit less often (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). The growth of the plant is generally restricted to the low to middle elevations (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). The plant is found in a range that extends along the west coast from Alaska to California. It is also found inland from the west coast, in locations such as Alberta, Idaho, and Montana (USDA & NRCS, 2022).

## Human Use
The predominant use of cedar is as lumber, whether for construction or for smaller items such as boxes (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). The rot resistant nature of cedar makes it useful for shingles.
### Indigenous Name (Downriver Halkomelem): xhpey'ulhp
The Red Cedar held an important place in the lives of the indigenous peoples of the west coast, and was used for a wide variety of purposes (Western Red Cedar: Detailed, n.d.). The fibrous bark was used for clothing and baskets, while the softer inner bark was used as tissue (Western Red Cedar: Detailed, n.d.). Both the bark and the thin roots were used to create rope (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). The wood was also utilised in construction, totem poles, and dugout canoes (Western Redcedar • Thuja Plicata, n.d.). This covers only a fraction of the uses, and cedar would have been used in tools, as fuel, and in many other ways (Western Red Cedar: Detailed, n.d.).

## Research
As a construction material, properties like strength and resistance to decay are valuable traits. This research investigated the impact heat treating had on those properties in cedar wood. The study found that heat treatment decreased the water uptake of the wood, while reducing the density and strength (Awoyemi & Jones, 2011). Some of these changes occurred due to structural changes at the microscopic level, such as the tracheids and ray tissues bursting, but chemical changes also occurred, and are likely responsible for the decreased water uptake in spite of the more open structure (Awoyemi & Jones, 2011). While changes such as reduced strength likely make this unappealing for structural elements, reduced water uptake might be a desirable trait for uses like shingles.

## Creative Component
During my research for this project I came across an ingredient called oak moss which was used in the flavoring of some gin. Upon further inspection, I found that oak moss was actually a lichen, and that it sometimes grew on conifers. I went looking for some, but could only find it growing on what I believe are Ginkgo trees growing in a neighbor’s yard. Because I could not find any growing on a cedar tree, I decided to also gather some fallen cedar boughs from around my yard.  
I hope to extract the scent compounds from these two, and have dried them both, ground them, and placed them in a neutral spirit. I started this task only a day ago, so it has not shown any results yet, but I’ve included pictures of my process so far.
