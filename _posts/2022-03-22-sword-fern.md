## Identification
Sword Ferns are large ferns, and are able to grow up to 1.5 M tall (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). The plant is evergreen, so it’s fronds are the best identification tool (Fern, Sword: Detailed, n.d.). The fronds emerge from the base of the fern as a rosette, giving the plant a circular footprint (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). Each frond is once pinnate, with distinctively shaped pinna alternating along its length (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). These pinna are on a short stem and are asymmetric, with an outgrowth near the base which resembles the hilt of a sabre that gives the plant its name (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). Pale yellow to dark orange sori are sometimes seen on the abaxial side of the pinna, but are not always present (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.).

## Ecology
Sword ferns are found in damp forests at low to mid elevation along the west coast (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). The ferns grow best in heavily shaded areas with moist nitrogen rich soil (Sword Fern, 2017). The plants are found primarily on the west coast, from Alaska to California, but also exist inland in Idaho, Montana, and 1 county of South Dakota (USDA & NRCS, 2022). Interestingly, an isolated population of the fern exists in Pennsylvania, which is just inland from the east coast (USDA & NRCS, 2022).

## Human Use
The predominant use of sword ferns outside of indigenous uses is as a decorative plant in gardens (‘Sword Fern’, 2016).
### Indigenous Name (Downriver Halkomelem): sthxhelum
The leaves of the Swordfern were used for lining pit ovens, to provide an insulating layer between the heat source and the food to be cooked, as well as to further insulate the food (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). The fern fronds were used in the lining of baskets and other containers (Sword Fern • Polystichum Munitum, n.d.). The leaves also saw use as a covering on floors or aa bedding material (Sword Fern, 2017). The rhizomes of the plant were dug up and roasted (Fern, Sword: Detailed, n.d.).

## Research
Sword ferns are found most often in areas with moist soil (Limm & Dawson, 2010). And as the climate continues to change, the frequency of rain, one of the major water sources for these plants, will likely decrease (Limm & Dawson, 2010). Research on sword ferns in the redwood forests of California found that the ferns can absorb fog through their fronds, but that the ability to do this varied by geographic location of the plants (Limm & Dawson, 2010). The study did not conclude as to whether this was an example of phenotypic plasticity or genetic differences between the populations at the different locations (Limm & Dawson, 2010). If the capacity is genetic, then changes in precipitation may have markedly different impacts on the various populations, while if the ability stems from phenotypic plasticity, then it bodes somewhat better for the ferns as the climate changes (Limm & Dawson, 2010).

## Creative Component
SILENCE 383 MILLION YEARS IN THE MAKING is a carbon black chainsaw which drips dark brown oil. It hates all animals. It functions as a chainsaw would be expected to, except it is whisper quiet in use.


WICKED WHISPERS WOVEN is a steely blade with emerald detailing, and a simple cord wrapped handle. It believes firmly that beauty exists in impermanence, and readily conflates beauty and good. The blade is thin enough that it can be coiled up and hidden on one's person as if it was a much smaller item.

	These are a 7 word chainsaw and 3 word sword respectively. Those in turn are formats some people have come up with for creating stuff for tabletop roleplaying games.
	Given the name of the plant, I figured I should write it up as a magical weapon like Sting from The Hobbit.
