## Identification
Tree Ruffle liverwort is a small non vascular plant with shiny leaves of varying colours (Tree Ruffle Liverwort • Porella Navicularis, n.d.). The stems are generally arranged horizontally to the ground, and have closely overlapping alternating “leaves” covering their upper surface (Tree Ruffle Liverwort • Porella Navicularis, n.d.). The underside of the liverwort has small underleaves running along the main stem, and also small offshoots to either side of the stem (Biodiversity of the Central Coast, n.d.). These offshoots are actually part of the upper leaves, folded under (Biodiversity of the Central Coast, n.d.).

## Ecology
The liverwort is generally found growing on the side of vertical surfaces, such as rocks and trees (Tree Ruffle Liverwort • Porella Navicularis, n.d.). It grows best in shaded areas, and is found in low elevation forests along the west coast (‘Porella Navicularis’, n.d.). Its range stretches from Alaska to Mexico (USDA & NRCS, 2022). 

## Research
Liverworts contain a vast array of chemicals, often for defensive purposes, that are not found in other plants or organisms (Ludwiczuk & Asakawa, 2019). In this 1997 study, the researchers re-analyzed the chemicals present in Porella navicularis and found 4 new sesquiterpenes that had not been previously known (Bungert et al., 1998).
