These are some rules I stole/stuck together to create a crafting system for a 5e game. They were specifically made for a necromancer priest, but should work just as well for other crafting with some modification. They've been only lightly tested.
## Fluff
With the spread of society, with all its structure and expectations, spirits slipped from reality, to a separate and still land. Half slumbering, they seek to return and live once more amongst the folk they were spun from. Those with souls partially unmoored, capable of contacting and summoning these spirits are known as necromancers.

The first step of the necromancer's work is to gather suitable materials. Materially, dead and broken things are suitable for the vessel. Metaphysically, a strong emotional or experiential element is required to serve as a conceptual beacon. Personal experiences are the easiest to use, although the emotions of others or memories of objects can also work.

In the second step, contact must be made with the spirit. Drugs, physical exhaustion, isolation, and more may be used, all with the effect of slipping part way from reality. Once there, the conceptual element is used to stir a spirit from stasis and draw it to the necromancer. Communication, and the establishment of contracts also occurs at this stage.

The third step is the creation of a body for the spirit to inhabit. In addition to letting the spirit interact with the physical world, the vessel must also cut a space in mundane reality for the spirit to manifest. This is most often achieved by invoking death or violence, although any challenge to normalcy can work.

If the above steps are carried out correctly, the desired spirit will fill in the vessel and animate it. No longer driven by a driving desire for freedom, the demands and desires of a spirit often grow increasingly diverse as they spend time in the world, and renegotiation is needed to maintain them.
## Mechanics
This uses 4e skill challenges, which track successes and failures over multiple skill checks. The players lay out a course of action they think will bring them closer to their desired outcome, and then make a check related to that course of action. If they can succeed (complexity) times before failing 3 times, they succeed.

1. Outline: A player pitches something they want to make, or cause happen that is in line with the themes of their craft and an emotional component they have.
2. GM determines the scale of the ritual and the necessary components. Rituals are complex and usually involve a multi step process, which is modeled as a skill challenge with a complexity and DC determined by the GM. Rituals involve components, the basic ingredients needed to perform the ritual and sometimes also carry greater costs, such as a sacrifice, a rare item, a new flaw, etc.
3. Preparation: The Player gathers the necessary components. They may also take this chance to garner edges by doing extra research, finding allies to aid them, sourcing exceptional ingredients, making sacrifices, etc.
4. Execution: The Player plays through the skill challenge. A rough rate of two checks per in game day should work, but is easily modified if not. Edges gained during preparation can advantage on one relevant roll during the skill challenge. A failed roll can also be negated by agreeing to a complication with the outcome.

The main limiting resource when crafting is access to the emotional components needed to contact spirits. A player might be able to create them during downtime with enough effort, but the baseline assumption is that they will be gained during the process of adventuring at a similar frequency as good magical treasure. If modeling something other than necromancy, a similar limiting resource should be invented.
## Untested Alternative
This is just the core resolution of [6e](https://wasitlikely.blogspot.com/2020/05/6e-game-where-everything-is-osr-problem.html) used in place of 4e's skill challenges.
Rather than abstracting the ritual in a way where the player controls the framing, this system instead relies on a random table to highlight smaller moments of challenge in the larger process. 

A 6e challenge is made up of a table of potential complications and a number of HP. Everytime the player overcomes a complication, or a previously overcome complication is rolled again, the HP of the challenge is reduced by 1. When the HP hits 0, the challenge is overcome.

Using this system, I think I'd have research reveal possible complications during the preparation phase; and exceptional ingredients and sacrifices let the player roll twice and pick on the table during execution. Getting Allies to help would just mean you have allies to help with resolving whatever complication gets rolled.
