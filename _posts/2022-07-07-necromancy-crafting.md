These are some rules I cobbled together for a 5e game around a year ago. They were designed for a necromancer priest, but I think the underlying system could be used for other magical crafting.

## Bones
This system doesn't use intricate recipes, but tries to encourage players to come up with compelling recipes themselves by having work done in excess of a basic recipe heavily weight the chance of success. Also, I've tried to combat the [potion problem](https://slugsandsilver.blogspot.com/2019/04/alchemists-and-resources-hard-nut-to.html) with **figments** as a limiting resource most easily generated through adventure in a way that (hopefully) doesn't feel too forced.

Those modifications aside, this is basically just a skill challenge from 4e. If you're unfamiliar with this, it's basically a series of player initiated checks in a mildly abstracted scenario, with the outcome of each check adding up to either an overall success or failure. A skill check will have a **DC** that the checks are made against, and a **complexity**, which is the number of successful checks that must occur before three failures for an overall success.

#### Steps
1. A player who has a **figment** proposes an item, magical effect, or the like that suits the figment and their character's style of crafting. Assuming this is approved by the GM, the GM and the player work to come up with a rudimentary list of essential ingredients; like bones and onyx for a skeleton, or etching acid and gems for a sword.
2. The GM sets the **DC** and **complexity** of the project, which should be high enough that success is reasonably unlikely for a level appropriate character making rolls without advantage.
3. The character gathers the necessary ingredients. They may also take this chance to accumulate edges by doing extra research, recruiting allies to help, sourcing exceptional ingredients, making sacrifices, etc.
4. The project is played through as a skill challenge, with the player suggesting steps of the project and making the accompanying rolls. Edges accumulated during preperation are spent to gain advantage on rolls as long as the edge granting advantage is somewhat plausible. The GM might also offer complications in exchange for negating a failure.

	The decision to use a skill challenge as the core resolution mechanic was influenced by a desire not to add weird things like dice pools or the like to simple d20 roll over 5e. If you don't want to use skill challenges, I think the core resolution mechanic of <a href="https://wasitlikely.blogspot.com/2020/05/6e-game-where-everything-is-osr-problem.html">6e</a> could work pretty well.
	<br><br>
	Instead of abstracting projects into a set of player directed skill checks, this system uses a table of random encounters (threats) to montage the project. Threats can be things like suspicious villagers, magicore going critical, demons wanting to renegotiate and the like. A progress bar filling up whenever a threat is overcome and whenever that entry is rolled again.
	<br><br>
	If I used this system, I think I'd modify research to reveal threats during preperation, and possibly make it so exceptional ingredients and sacrifices allow the player to roll twice on the table and pick which threat occurs during execution. Allies and other forms of preparation would simply be useful for dealing with whichever threats were rolled.

## Skin
With the spread of society, with all its structure and expectations, spirits slipped from reality, to a separate and still land. Half slumbering, they seek to return and live once more amongst the folk they were spun from. Those with souls partially unmoored, capable of contacting and summoning these spirits are known as necromancers.

The first step of the necromancer's work is to gather suitable materials. Materially, dead and broken things are suitable for the vessel. Metaphysically, a strong emotional or experiential element is required to serve as a conceptual beacon. Personal experiences are the easiest to use, although the emotions of others or memories of objects can also work.

In the second step, contact must be made with the spirit. Drugs, physical exhaustion, isolation, and more may be used, all with the effect of slipping part way from reality. Once there, the conceptual element is used to stir a spirit from stasis and draw it to the necromancer. Communication, and the establishment of contracts also occurs at this stage.

The third step is the creation of a body for the spirit to inhabit. In addition to letting the spirit interact with the physical world, the vessel must also cut a space in mundane reality for the spirit to manifest. This is most often achieved by invoking death or violence, although any challenge to normalcy can work.

If the above steps are carried out correctly, the desired spirit will fill in the vessel and animate it. No longer driven by a driving desire for freedom, the demands and desires of a spirit often grow increasingly diverse as they spend time in the world, and renegotiation is needed to maintain them.
