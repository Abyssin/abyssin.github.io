## Identification
Salal is a medium shrub which grows between 0.2 m and 5 m tall (Salal: Detailed, n.d.). It has thick leathery evergreen leaves. The leaves are oval in shape and have minute serration along their edge and a pointed tip (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.). In spring, the plant possesses rows of hanging small bell shaped flowers, which range in colour from white to pink (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.). These flowers have superior ovaries, with fleshy sepals covering the ovary (Douglas et al., 1999). In the summer, Salal shrubs produce purplish black small fruits. These fruits are a type of accessory fruit, and the flesh is actually the thickened sepals of the flower (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.). Both the fruit and the flowers have short hairs on their surface, and secrete a sticky residue (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.).

## Ecology
Salal is a shade tolerant plant, and is found often as dense clumps in the understory of forests (Salal, 2017; Salal: Detailed, n.d.). It is also sometimes found on rocky outcroppings and in bogs (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.), and is able to tolerate a pH down to 5.5 pH (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.; USDA & NRCS, 2022). The range of the plant stretches from Alaska to California, and while the plant is more common towards the coast, it also occurs in the interior of British Columbia (Salal: Detailed, n.d.; USDA & NRCS, 2022).

## Human Use
The is commonly used as a horticultural plant under the name “Lemon Leaf” as a decorative plant (Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.; McDougall et al., 2016). The leaves are also used in arrangements, where the leaves are valued for their ability to stay in suitable shape for long periods of time (Salal, 2017). The fruits are also edible, with a mealy texture and mild sweet flavour (Douglas et al., 1999; Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.). However, they are not currently harvested commercially.
### Indigenous Name (Upriver Halkomelem): t’eqe:lhp
The Native Americans ate the berries both fresh and dried (Salal: Detailed, n.d.). In addition to being eaten by themselves, the berries were added to other dishes to sweeten or thicken them (Salal • Gaultheria Shallon, n.d.). The leaves were also used as seasoning in some dishes (Salal, 2017).

## Research
Recently, research was done on the suitability of salal as a wine making fruit. The research was carried out due to the limited variety of crops that were viable to grow on the Orkney archipelago. The results of the research indicated that the wines made from salal had high amounts of anthocyanins, likely due to the stability of the anthocyanins in the fruit (McDougall et al., 2016). The paper also comments on the possibility of the production of salal wines in areas where it currently grows.

## Creative Component
Shivering in shade, shallon sheltered

Holding fast on, foliage iced hoary

Until cold chimes ring out rains-return

And strung bells sing in sweetened imitation

	 This is a form of poetry I've been playing around with based on Anglo-Saxon works such as The Wanderer. Rather than focusing on a rhyming scheme or syllables, it instead emphasizes alliteration and consonants.
	 Structure should roughly be two consonants, a break, followed by two more consonants. Ideally there would be alliteration across the break.
 	One other feature is the use of kennings, compound words and allusions such as the kenning for ocean: whale-road.
